The recipe is adapted from &quot;The Chinese Menu Cookbook&quot; by Joanne Hush and Peter Wong.  In case anyone is interested, the difference between an egg roll and a spring roll is the wrapper. Spring rolls use a very light, delicate wrapper that requires a lot of care to keep from getting holes poked in it. Egg roll wrappers are an egg noodle dough, exactly the same as wonton wrappers but larger in size. This filling can be used with either. The secret is to squeeze out the moisture after cooling so it doesn't soak through the wrapper during deep frying. They should be deep fried at relatively cool temperature (325&deg; - 350&deg;F) until about half cooked. Then either refrigerate or freeze until ready to serve. Finish the deep frying at 375; this double process insures a well cooked, hot inside with a golden brown crispy outside. (Defrost if frozen).

H. Fairfax Company, Columbia Md.).  I've been cooking from this book for so long now 
the pages are all frayed and dog-earred.  The recipes here are truly tried and tested -- comfort food at its best.  But first...a bit of info.  Let's start with just what exactly is a Griot.  PBS.org in it's study on blues in America defines a Griot (pronounced 'GREE oh') as a West African performer who perpetuates the oral traditions of a family, village, or leader by singing histories and tales. Griots typically perform alone, accompanying themselves on a stringed instrument, and are considered by many musicologists a critical African root of the solo acoustic blues that developed among African American communities during the early 20th century.  En.wikipedia.org calls them wordsmiths who use poetry, proverbs, and rhythm to teach villagers about their history. Their home is the territory of the Mande peoples, i.e. the states of Mali, Gambia, Guinea and Senegal, where their tradition is alive to this day. &quot;Griot&quot; is the French term for this class of musicians; the local terms are jeli in northern Mande areas and jali in southern Mande domains.  In the Bambara and Malinke 
languages &quot;djeli&quot; means &quot;griot&quot; and also &quot;blood&quot;. In their inherited duty and vocation, the djeli are the life-blood of Malian society. As oral historians, storytellers, singers and musicians, they keep the past in living contact with the present by acting as ajudicators, arbitrators, even match-makers. Both men and women practice this vocation.  As you can guess, this is a very special cookbook and well-beloved in my house.  This book is now rare and extremely difficult to find.  It was compiled by American Griots Alice McGill, Mary Carter Washington and Elmira M. 
Washington, all well-known and familiar local names if you were born and bred in Baltimore.  The book was created as a fund-raiser for the local jazz station, WEAA broadcasting from the campus of Morgan State University which is where I work.  With that background, I shall share the very first recipe that appears in the book...don't be afraid to read it through.

When making the fresh ginger marinade for the beef in this recipe (or anything that's going to be grilled), use just the grated ginger juice, not the ginger fiber. The fiber burns quickly, giving the beef a scorched taste, which you don't want.

Pickled mountain burdock (yamagobo) looks like skinny carrots and tastes like pickled parsnips. It's an extraordinary flavor to couple with ginger-flavored beef. The only tricky part of the recipe is not tearing the tender lettuce as you work with it. That's why it's wisest to blanch extra pieces of lettuce so that you have plenty to work with.

The intro to the recipe says, &quot;Couscous with fish is popular along the Tunisian coast. Saffron, cumin and coriander are the usual spices; if you wish, use Tabil instead of the cumin and coriander. Grey mullet or bream would probably be used in Tunisia, but you could use any firm-fleshed fish. Reserve all the fish and vegetable trimmings so you can make a well-flavored stock.&quot; When I made this, I used haddock and I took one shortcut: I used pre-made fish stock. I also ignored this recipe’s couscous preparation and used the instructions on the box. I ground the Tabil spice ingredients in my Magic Bullet. For harissa, I used chili garlic paste. I also added a tablespoon of unsalted butter when saut&eacute;ing the vegetables.

SUSHI ETIQUETTE:
Sushi is meant to be finger food, quick and tasty. It is preferable to eat sushi with ones hands rather than with chopsticks, but both ways are acceptable in America.

Eat the whole sushi roll at once. It is not appropriate to eat part of a piece of sushi and place the other piece back on a plate. Once you have picked something up you should eat all of it. 

Do not dip the California rolls into the Soy sauce  as the rice portion of the sushi will become too moist and can cause sushi to fall apart. Maki rolls can be dipped into the Soy because the seaweed (Nori) is on the ouside and will hold it together.   Simply dip into the soy sauce before eating.","""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/40/03/33/picoc28xT.jpg""",Japanese,"c(""Asian"", ""< 30 Mins"")","c(""1/2"", ""1"", ""4"", ""4"", ""1/3"", ""1"", ""4"", NA, NA, NA)","c(""lemon"", ""avocado"", ""nori"", ""sushi rice"", ""Sushi Rice Made in Bamboo Steamer"", ""sesame seeds"", ""cucumber"", ""pickled ginger"", ""wasabi"", ""soy sauce"")",5.0,1.0,141.2,2.4,0.4,0.0,3.2,26.9,1.8,0.3,2.7,,24 pieces,"c(""Squeeze the lemon juice over the avocado to prevent browning."", ""Cover a bamboo rolling mat with plastic wrap."", ""Cut nori sheets in half crosswise."", ""Lay 1 sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the plastic covered mat."", ""To make Califronia Rolls:"", ""Wet your fingers with water and spread approximately 1/2 cup of the rice evenly onto the nori."", ""Sprinkle the rice with sesame seeds."", ""Place the second plastic covered bamboo rolling mat on top and flip the two over so that the rice side is down."",

I found the base of this recipe on about.com, but after tinkering, the final recipe is a bit different...better, I think. :)

Basil &amp; cilantro: do not mince or chop. Looks much better when whole...like garnish you actually eat.

YOU MAY SUBSTITUTE THE SZECHUAN PEPPERCORN WITH WHITE PEPPER, WHICH IS A POPULAR BLEND FOR USE IN CHINESE COOKERY. KEEP IN MIND -- \""A LITTLE BIT OF FIVE SPICE POWDER GOES A LONG WAY\"". WHEN SEASONING FOODS, START WITH A SMALL AMOUNT, THEN ADJUST ACCORDINGLY."", 
""MEASURE all ingredients into a clean spice mill or coffee grinder, whether whole or ground, using pre-ground cinnamon as the only exception: 1 tablespoon cinnamon, 1 tablespoon cloves, 1 tablespoon fennel, 1 tablespoon star anise, 1 tablespoon Szechuan peppercorn."", ""GRIND mixture in a clean spice mill or coffee grinder in 15-30 second increments, until mixture is finely powderized."", ""Store in an airtight container."", ""Use measure-for-measure in any recipe calling for Chinese Five Spice powder.""

Japanese restaurants often call them gyoza, however very few actually spend the time to cook them right. Most places offer steamed or fried. The best way is to pan fry them in a tiny bit of oil, then pour in water and let them steam cook until the water disappears. This recipe shows you how to do just that! The recipe for making your own wrappers is included, and more fresh (if you have a tortilla press) however, I usually get my wrappers at an Oriental Foods store, or in a pinch I ask for the wrappers from a local restaurant that makes them. If you buy them look for this brand / type: Twin Marquis Dumpling Wrapper (Shanghai Style). Don't try to use the wonton skins; they don't turn out the same (believe me I've tried...)

It is a delicious ingredient in many foods, has antibacterial properties, works as a humectant (keeps things moist), soothes a cough or sore throat, and makes your tea about 1,000 better-and that&rsquo;s just scratching the surface really. Whether you&rsquo;re using it as a sweetener, or trying to kick a cough, it&rsquo;s just plain useful.

Toss in 2 slices for boosted flavor if you like. Heat these together for about 10 minutes, making sure to keep the heat relatively low. Burned honey doesn’t taste as bad as some other things do burned, but you still want to avoid it. Around 115 degrees Fahrenheit releases the flavors nicely, but it will depend on your stovetop. After you’ve heated the mixture, let it sit for 1-2 hours or up to 1-2 weeks. After its infused strain if you’d like, and place in a glass jar with a tightly fitting top. Know the longer it sits for the stronger it will taste."", 
""Good to use: If you have a bad cough or cold, place a healthy dollop of your lemon infused honey at the bottom of a cup. Pour freshly boiled water over the top, drop in a teabag, and give it a good stir. The lemon can loosen phlegm, while the honey soothes irritation. You can also slowly heat the lemon infused honey while adding the juice of one freshly squeezed lemon. When it’s still hot and liquid, sip slowly."", ""Cinnamon Honey:"", ""Pour 1 cup of honey into the saucepan, and drop in the cinnamon sticks. Push them down with a spoon to submerge them. For 10 minutes on low heat let the mixture heat up, and then let it sit for around 2 hours or up to 1-2 weeks. Strain if you’d like and store in glass jar."", 
""Good if used: In tea, just like the lemon-honey, or eaten straight off the spoon. It’s also delicious spread on a plain piece of toast. Cinnamon is chock full of anti-oxidants, possesses antifungal properties, and helps break up congestions/clear the sinuses. Even just a half a teaspoon a day has been shown to lower cholesterol levels."", ""Ginger Honey:"", ""Pour 1 cup of honey into a saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of finely chopped gingerroot. You can add a small pinch of ground ginger if you’d like as well, but it does have a strong flavor. On low heat let the mixture sit for 10 minutes. When it’s done let it infuse for 2 hours or up to 2 weeks in a glass jar with a tightly fitting lid. Strain when it’s finished if you’d like."", 
""Best used: In your tea when you’re feeling ill-especially with an upset tummy, since both ginger and honey are known to soothe your stomach and chase off “bugs.” The added ginger helps circulation, flushing toxins through your systems and helping get rid of aches and chills. If you’re in a pinch and have wound up with a minor abrasion, applying this cooled and then covering with gauze can help it heal , and the ginger fights inflammation."", ""Not to be confused with clover honey, clove honey is made by infusing whole cloves with honey, whereas clover honey is made from the nectar of clover flowers. Cloves are great at numbing pain (sore throats, toothaches, etc.) and the honey makes a happy, healthy, medium to ingest it with."", 
""Pour 1 cup of honey into a saucepan, and then add 5-10 whole cloves. On low, heat for 10 minutes before letting it infuse for 2 hours or up to 2 weeks,  putting it in a jar with a tightly fitting lid. Strain when it’s finished if you’d like."", ""Best used: In tea when you have a sore throat or a toothache, or dabbed directly on the gum by a sore tooth. The eugenol in the clove is a powerful numbing agent that was used by dentists before modern painkillers were created, and is so effective it is still used in modern dentistry in an extracted form. If you have a little cut or sore in your mouth, the honey may help it heal faster and keep bad bacteria out while the cloves take care of the discomfort."", 
""Apple Cider Vinegar Honey:"", ""Add 1 cup of honey to a saucepan, and then pour in 2-3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. Let it heat over low heat for 10 minutes, stirring well about halfway through. Place in a jar and let it sit for as long as you like-its taste and benefits are all there pretty quickly, and it doesn’t need to sit as long as something like cinnamon sticks or cloves would."", ""Best:If you make the Braggs apple cider vinegar health drink you can try adding this for an extra kick. While this is subject to opinion, I think it tastes good stirred in to tea or a glass of lemon water in the morning. Apple cider vinegar can help neutralize and correct excess acidity in our bodies (counterintuitive, but often times true) and helps a number of issues from an upset stomach to easing sore throats to showing promise in treating diabetes."", 
""Storage:"", ""The shelf-life, if stored in a glass jar with a tightly fitting lid, is 6 months. Some people say it can last years, but I have never experimented with that. Even with plant matter, it can go a long time (microorganisms have a hard time surviving on/in it) without needing to be refrigerated. Simply store in a cool place away from direct sunlight. Straining is more for looks/taste, and is easiest when the honey has been warmed slightly after sitting for a few hours so it is runnier. If you want to let it infuse for longer than several hours, pour it into your jar so it’s not sitting out in the open for a super long time. When it’s infused enough, simply re-heat before straining by placing the jar in warm water if you’d like."", 
""Tips:"", ""-If crystals form, set the honey (in its jar) in a pot of gently simmered water. The crystals will “melt” and your honey will be smooth again."", ""-A nice touch for flavor is to add 3 tablespoons of diced or roughly chopped fruit. Apple-strawberry is one of my favorite flavors for eating on toast with butter. I don’t strain it at the end either."", ""-Flavored honey makes an awesome gift in a nice decorative jar, and you can actually get “honeystix” at many craft/party stores."", ""-Freely adjust to taste, and experiment. It’s not an exact science, and it’s all about what you like and what’s good for you.""

This is an awesome recipe that I made up, it has bold, sweet and spicy full flavors. If you love Thai food there is no doubt in my mind that you will LOVE this. Plan on spending some time doing it though, I think I was in the kitchen for 2 1/2-3 hours before we actually ate but I love cooking and taking my time. I'm sure it could be shortened, but its nice to have the time as it allows the flavors to meld so nicely. It will be hard for me to estimate the prep and cook times because with this you are cooking and prepping at the same time. I don't measure anything so I will be guessing on some of the quantities but just remember that you can reduce or add some ingredients as you see fit based on your tastes. You should be able to find all of these ingredients at a larger type regular grocery store in the Asian section.

""Melt butter in a Dutch oven (large pot) be sure to not burn it, adding a few drops of oil to it will prevent this. Add all of the minced and chopped veggies to the butter including the zest of 2 limes (do not add the chunks of lemongrass and the sliced part of the ginger; reserve for later).  Sauté all the veggies for a bit of time, the longer you do it the more the flavors meld, don’t burn them however.  Clean and cut chicken breasts in chunks or strips, bite sized or a bit larger, whatever you prefer. Once veggies are sufficiently sautéed then add your chicken breasts and sauté/simmer until the chicken is cooked and flavors have melded."", 
""Now add the chicken broth to the pan, add lemongrass chunks, ginger slices, brown sugar, sweet soy glaze, as well as cayenne, salt and pepper both to taste. (Again, I don’t measure anything so it’s hard for me to put an exact measurement on these so if you are unsure err on the less side and add more later if desired.)

I probably let heat this way for maybe 20-30mins but again, could be less if time is an issue.  Taste your soup.  If you would like your soup sweeter add more soy glaze or brown sugar, if you want it spicier, add more cayenne or hot green chilies or slice fresh jalapenos for garnish when serving.  Stir soup frequently while heating."", 
""After adding coconut milk to soup boil a large pan of water for the noodles and cook them al-dente or just under done which is what I did because once served with the hot soup it will cook them a tad bit. Rinse in cold water to stop cooking and set aside.

Also if you prefer, you could use any type of Asian noodles that you like, there are many choices and you could play around with different types."", 
""After the noodles are cooked and the soup has heated through and melded flavors, use a slotted spoon and dip all through the soup and pull out the chunks of lemongrass and ginger slices, these are very strong and stalky and you don’t really want to be eating your soup and bite into one of those.  Now add the can of straw mushrooms and the can of regular mushrooms. Wash your baby spinach and basil and add that to your soup, it will wilt pretty quickly then you will be ready to serve. If you want to garnish with basil as well, then you need to save out a few leaves for that. Maybe continue heating another 5-10 minutes so that the greens and mushrooms heat through. Taste your soup one last time to insure you have the proper sweet/spicy balance as well as your salt and pepper."",

""Note: If you want to roast your own green chili, you need to pick nice sized pablano peppers, I put 2 in but you could definitely use more or less if desired.  Pick ones that are as smooth as possible as opposed to very crunched up, you will be looking for an even roast so if it has lots of nooks and crannies then it’ll be harder to get the roast in those places. You want to roast on your BBQ, if that is not available you can do it in a gas stove. You want to roast until the peel is black but not burnt all the way through to the inside. Once roasted, cover with a towel for 5 minutes then peel the skin off, it should come off easily after roasting.  Also, deseed the chili too unless you like to keep the seeds in your dishes."",

&quot;Mastering the art of creating traditional nigiri sushi (small pads of rice topped with raw fish) is best left to those who are willing to devote several years to intensive study and apprenticeship. Japanese eat sushi in restaurants or buy it from take-out establishments.
Chirashizushi is simply sushi toppings scattered over a bowl of sushimeshi. The taste is similar to the sushi you eat in restaurants but is much easier to prepare. The idea is to make the dish both look pretty and taste good.

It’s on a busy strip that comprises a sort of entertainment district for people from Isaan (Northeast Thailand), who make up a good portion of the working class in the city. All of the city’s cab drivers, primarily men from Isaan, seem to know the place. The crowd is a mix of construction workers, also primarily men from Isaan; women; and kathoey, men who dress flamboyantly like women."", 
""Before you pass through the dark door, a gentleman brusquely pats you down to make sure you’re not packing. Sadly, in this atmosphere, acts of passion-fueled violence are not uncommon. You join the rabble in the audience, dodging inebriates and noting the visiting dignitaries—and I don’t mean heads of state. Amid the shit show, they’re the ones with the cherry tables, expensive whiskey, and many admirers who crowd around hoping for handshakes. On a stage that looks as if it’s been plastered with glitter, a band plays almost nonstop, and a varying cast of characters—nearly a dozen different singers who later reappear as backup dancers and, sometimes, end up pouring your drinks—perform deafening renditions of songs that everyone but you seems to know. The music is morlam and lukthung, mournful songs depicting the hardships of country living or ribald stories of love. The numbers are highly choreographed. Some particularly happy customers show their appreciation by stuffing money into shirt collars and waistbands."", 
""A couple of friends, two longtime expats and enthusiastic explorers, put me onto this place, which they stumbled into while on the prowl for duck laap. As soon as I got to Bangkok—or at least, after a few plates of laap and some deep-fried duck bills at a restaurant next door—I went to experience Lam Sing Pla Tong for myself. The night before I flew back to the States, I went again. I came for the fun. I came back for the cashews."", ""To sustain us that first night, my entourage and I ordered a few dishes from the menu, a typical booze-friendly collection of fried stuff and salads but with an Isaan bent. What got me was a plate of fried cashews, aggressively salted and tossed with roughly chopped green onions and fresh red chiles in chunks big enough to inspire alarm. I spent the rest of the night shoveling down this salty, spicy, crunchy snack between slugs of beer."", 
""Since then, I’ve ordered the dish every time I’ve spotted it. Sometimes what I receive is a variation that’s closer to yam (or so-called Thai salads), complete with fish sauce, lime juice, raw shallots, and ground pork. The version at Lam Sing Pla Tong reflects the dish at its simplest. And it’s the one I like best."", ""SPECIAL EQUIPMENT:"", ""A deep-fry thermometer."", ""A large spider skimmer (recommended)."", ""MAKE THE CASHEWS:"", ""Pour the oil to a depth of 1/2 inch / 12 mm into small saucepan, set over medium heat, and heat to 325°F / 165°C Use the thermometer to test the temperature, measuring the oil at the center of the vessel and carefully stirring the oil occasionally to ensure a consistent temperature. Line a bowl with paper towels or newspaper and put it near the stove."", 
""Carefully add the cashews to the hot oil and cook, stirring constantly, until light golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes.

The flavors of tamarind juice, soy sauce and fish sauce vary by brand, so now more than ever is the time to adjust to taste. Our version has a well-balanced tangy, sweet and salty flavor. Since we cook with young people whose tastebuds don&rsquo;t always welcome spiciness, we added it on the side. Feel free to add it to your own sauce until it tastes right to you. (If you don&rsquo;t have tamarind sauce on hand, you can make a mixture of equal parts lime juice and brown sugar to taste. If you do this, you may need to adjust the amount of sugar that the recipe already calls for. You&rsquo;re looking for a balanced sweet and sour flavor.)

Many of our crops this time of year only need a quick saut&eacute; in oil to enhance their freshly harvested qualities, and that&rsquo;s what we do here with the cabbage and asparagus. We&rsquo;ve found our garden&rsquo;s cabbage is irresistibly sweet, crunchy and tender. I admit that I would rarely describe cabbage as irresistible, but I&rsquo;m telling you, my love for cabbage this time of year has no bounds. If you are looking for a sidekick to your bowl of pad thai, our recipe for Asian coleslaw is just the candidate. The two must have met in sweet, salty, crunchy heaven.

&quot;Back when my sister and I were younger, brattier, and far less appreciative of my mother&rsquo;s amazing cooking, we would beg my mom to let us order pizza for dinner. Instead of giving in to our demands, she came up with this compromise: our favorite pizza toppings, but on roti. As it turns out, roti makes an excellent pizza crust&mdash;it chars and crisps up nicely, and it doesn&rsquo;t get soggy under the weight of the
toppings. Roti pizza is now the most-made dish in our house, and we&rsquo;ve gotten really creative with topping variations. We&rsquo;ve graduated from mozzarella and tomato and moved toward newer discoveries, like potatoes, rosemary, and Parmesan (an innovative Spanish-slash-Italian pizza), or chutney, cheddar, and onion (salty, spicy, and very addictive). Feel free to get as creative as you want! Try making it with sweet ingredients, like cinnamon-sprinkled apples or Nutella and strawberries. Roti pizza parties are for all.&quot; - Priya Krishna","""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/53/85/21/xf4XD9KHTue4Bm1CfmEE_04-009a-rotipizza-482471.jpg""",Indian,"c(""< 15 Mins"", ""Easy"")","c(NA, NA, ""1"", ""1"", ""2"", ""1"", ""1"", ""2"")","c(""olive oil"", ""red onion"", ""sharp cheddar cheese"", ""Cilantro Chutney from Indian-Ish"", ""russet potato"", ""parmesan cheese"", ""fresh rosemary"")",,,541.4,33.3,20.7,103.3,1123.6,25.0,3.2,3.1,35.9,2.0,,"c(""Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F."", ""Score each roti a few times with a knife or fork.

This version of sauce is by far the most flavorful IMHO. When cooking the sauce, don&rsquo;t use too much heat so that would burn the garlic. Sometimes I forget to add the water to the sauce and that is ok. Also, you can substitute ghee (purified butter) for the oil in the sauce for better flavor. I use homemade ghee. When cutting the beef, tilt the blade of your knife at about a forty five degree angle to the top of the steak so that you get wider cuts.
